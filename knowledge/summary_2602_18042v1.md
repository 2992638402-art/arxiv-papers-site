## 📝 摘要

Accurate, real-time, yet non-destructive estimation of internal states in lithium-ion batteries is critical for predicting degradation, optimizing usage strategies, and extending operational lifespan. Here, we introduce PINEAPPLE (Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter inference in Lithium-ion battery Electrodes), a novel framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with an evolutionary search algorithm to enable rapid, scalable, and interpretable parameter inference with potential for application to next-generation batteries. The meta-learned PINN utilizes fundamental physics principles to achieve accurate zero-shot prediction of electrode behavior with test errors below 0.1$\%$ while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speed-up over conventional solvers. PINEAPPLE demonstrates robust parameter inference solely from voltage-time discharge curves across multiple batteries from the open-source CALCE repository, recovering the evolution of key internal state parameters such as Li-ion diffusion coefficients across usage cycles. Notably, the inferred cycle-dependent evolution of these parameters exhibit consistent trends across different batteries without any customized degradation physics-embedded heuristic, highlighting the effective regularizing effect and robustness that can be conferred through incorporation of fundamental physics in PINEAPPLE. By enabling computationally efficient, real-time parameter estimation, PINEAPPLE offers a promising route towards the non-destructive, physics-based characterization of inter-cell and intra-cell variability of battery modules and battery packs, thereby unlocking new opportunities for downstream on-the-fly needs in next-generation battery management systems such as individual cell-scale state-of-health diagnostics.
